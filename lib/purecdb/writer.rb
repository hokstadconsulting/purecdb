  #
  # Write 32 or 64 bit CDB files
  #
  # == Memory considerations
  #
  # While the entry is written to the target object immediately on calling #store, the actual
  # hash tables can not be written until the full dataset is ready. You must therefore be able
  # to hold the hash of each key (including duplicates) and the position in the file the full
  # netry is stored at in memory while building the CDB file.
  #
  # It would be possible to write this to a temporary file at the cost of performance, but the
  # current implementation does not do this.
  #
  # As a compromise, the current implementation stores the hashes and positions as a BER encoded
  # string per hash bucket until it is ready to write it to disk.
  #
  class Writer < Base
    # How full any given hash table is allowed to get, as a float between 0 and 1.
    #
    # Needs to be <= 1. The lower it is, the fewer records will collide. The closer to 1 it is,
    # the more frequently the reader may have to engage in potentially lengthy (worst case
    # scanning all the records) probing to find the right entry

    # Open a CDB file for writing, or preparing an IO like object for writing.
    #
    # :call-seq:
    #   w = PureCDB::Writer.new(target)
    #   w = PureCDB::Writer.new(target, *options)
    #   PureCDB::Writer.new(target)  {|w| ... }
    #   PureCDB::Writer.new(target, *options) {|w| ... }
    #
    # If +:mode+ is passed in +options+, it must be the integers 32 or 64, indicating whether
    # you wish to write a standard (32 bit) CDB file, or a 64 bit CDB-like file. The default
    # is 32.
    #
    # If +target+ is a +String+ it is treated as a filename of a file to be opened to write to.
    # Otherwise +target+ is assumed to be an IO-like object that ideally responds to #sysseek
    # and #syswrite. If it doesn't, it will be wrapped with an object delegating #sysseek and
    # #syswrite to #seek and #write respectively, and these must be present.
    #
    # (+IO+ and +StringIO+ both satisfy these requirements)
    #
    # If passed a block, the writer is yielded to the block and PureCDB::Writer#close is called
    # afterwards.
    #
    # **WARNING:** To complete writing the hash tables, you *must* ensure #close is called
    # when you are done.
